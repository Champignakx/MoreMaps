# MoreMaps
A mod for Project Zomboid that adds more maps to the game, including maps of other mods.

###### Follow these steps to add a map:
- define the map item in newMaps.txt
- define sandbox options and sandbox text in sandbox-options.txt and Sandbox_EN.txt
- initialise map data in initNewMaps.lua (select the right map folder is this is a map for a mod)
- add the map to distributions in Distributions_newMaps.lua (but don't necessarily add the map to all distributions)
- add the map as a forageable item in ForagingDefinitions_newMaps.lua
