This mod adds map items of vanilla map locations and modded map locations.
They can all be disabled through Sandbox options if you don't think a specific location should have a map.
Maps of mods will also be disabled if you haven't activated the mod. (Even if the tickbox is checked if you don't have the mods the corresponding maps won't spawn.)

[u][b]Exceptions:[/b][/u]
[list]
[*] Bedford Falls: The Beford Falls mod itself already adds a map item, so no need for me to add another. I tweaked its distribution tables though.
[*] St Bernard's Hill : Idem.
[/list]
Some mods have not added the ingame map feature to their map zones yet, so I can't make map items for them.
Once they have mapped their mod, I will add the corresponding item (if they haven't already).

[h1]WARNING : READ THIS[/h1]
If you want to use one of these maps items:
Eerie Country maps, Slocan Lake maps, Fort Knox linked to Eerie Country, Fort Redstone, West Point Expansion, Glenport,

[u][b]ALSO:[/b][/u] If it still doesn't work, try changing the load order. Most problems come from the load order. If you don't know how to change the mod loading order, check out the mod "Mod Manager".

If you are still struggling getting the map data of these old mods to show up on the world map, take your problem to alree_unjammer, it is not my responsability.
